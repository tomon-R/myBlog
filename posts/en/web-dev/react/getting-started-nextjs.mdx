# Getting Started with Next.js 15

Next.js 15 brings exciting new features and improvements that make building React applications even better. In this article, we'll explore the key updates and how to get started.

## What's New in Next.js 15?

Next.js 15 introduces several groundbreaking features:

- **Improved Performance**: Faster builds and optimized runtime
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Better error messages and debugging tools
- **New Routing Features**: More flexible routing options
- **Server Actions**: Simplified server-side logic

## Installing Next.js 15

Getting started is simple. Just run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will create a new Next.js 15 project with all the latest features configured out of the box.

## Key Features to Try

### 1. App Router

The App Router continues to be the recommended way to build Next.js applications:

```typescript
// app/page.tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Welcome to Next.js 15!</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

### 2. Server Components

React Server Components are now stable and provide excellent performance benefits:

```typescript
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  return res.json();
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData();
  return <div>{data.title}</div>;
}
```

### 3. Improved Image Optimization

The Image component has been enhanced with better defaults:

```typescript
import Image from 'next/image';

export default function Avatar() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/avatar.jpg"
      alt="User Avatar"
      width={200}
      height={200}
    />
  );
}
```

## Performance Tips

Here are some best practices for optimal performance:

1. **Use Server Components** when possible for better initial load times
2. **Implement Code Splitting** to reduce bundle sizes
3. **Optimize Images** using the built-in Image component
4. **Leverage Caching** for API responses and static data

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 is a powerful update that makes building modern web applications easier and more efficient. Whether you're starting a new project or upgrading an existing one, these features will help you build better applications faster.
